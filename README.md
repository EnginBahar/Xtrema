# Xtrema

Xtrema is a Python tool designed to automatically calculate the times of minimum and maximum light for each cycle in stellar light curves. It offers a robust graphical interface and includes additional features such as basic frequency analysis and light curve normalization.

# Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- PyAstronomy
- Astropy
- PlotPy
- PyQt5


# Usage

Run the main script with the following command:

    python Xtrema.py
